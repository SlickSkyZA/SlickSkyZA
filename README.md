I am Andre Joubert. I am from South Africa and is a Self-Taught Developer / Digital Marketing / freelance and love what i do for me it more off a passion then a job i started my own small bussnis Coding Studio and focus manly on the freelance as the community is so big and supportive and i can fokus my full attention on my client needs.

My reason for choosing to freelance is not technical. It was more of a personal choice for me, as a “follow your heart and let it lead the way”.

There is an estimate that by 2020, 40% of the working will be freelancers. We are escaping from the industrial era where everyone was working from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. 


Aldo i am self Self-Taught is there hard in my work i give every ounce of what i can do the acceded the higes posible outcome.
